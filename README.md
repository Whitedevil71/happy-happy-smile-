Smile Rewards AI ‚ú®
A web application that uses computer vision and generative AI to create a positive and engaging experience, rewarding users for their smiles.
Smile Rewards AI is an interactive web project that leverages the power of browser-based machine learning and large language models. It accesses the user's webcam to perform real-time face detection and expression analysis. When a smile is detected, the user earns points and builds a daily streak, gamifying the act of smiling.
